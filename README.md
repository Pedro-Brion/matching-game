## The Project
Project inspired by the v√≠deo **[Do This Instead Of Representing State With Booleans](https://youtu.be/4Lom_lqSGoY)**, created by the youtube channel **[Joy of Code](https://www.youtube.com/@JoyofCodeDev)**.

The main objective is to create a Matching game, powered by [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/), using the [State Machine](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/state) pattern. Additionally, I'm using this project as an opportunity to explore Svelte for the first time, experimenting with Svelte's features such as **store, reactivity, lifecycle, animations** and more.
